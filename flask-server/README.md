# Video Dubber
This program takes in a video (in English, for now) and a target language and produces a version of it that is dubbed in the target language. This is for easier access of informative videos for people whose native language is not English. It will later be updated to have the option to dub videos from any language to the desired one.

The best use for this program is for relatively monotone/less emotive content, as it is trickier to have the translated versions also have the emotional richness of most entertainment material like movies and tv shows. A future version of this will aim to be adaptable enough to enable emotive content.
